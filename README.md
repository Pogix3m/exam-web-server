## Getting Started

Getting up and running locally is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

1. Go to directory

    ```
    cd path/to/directory
    ```

1. _Optional_: if you have nvm installed. This is to be able to set correct node version(`v20.8.0`)

    ```
    nvm use
    ```

1. Install dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

1. Start your app

    ```
    npm start
    ```
